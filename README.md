# React CryptoCurrency Tracker

A cryptocurrency tracker/dashboard built using React, Chart.js, and the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).

**DISCLAIMER**: I did not design/build this project entirely by myself, although I have made some modifications and improvements over the original design. I created it as a code-along project for Sanjeev Thiyagarajan's great tutorial, [Re-Upload: CryptoCurrency Tracker: React + chart.js w/ hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m-3qnEXIUk&list=WL&index=2).
